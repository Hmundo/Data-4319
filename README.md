# Data-4319
This repository contains 10 machine learning algorithms written mostly from scratch. A lot of the code was given to us by DR. Randy Davila in class, which served as a spring to further develop the Algorithms. 
These are the projects you can expect to see in this respoitory:
1. Perceptron in Python
2. Perceptron in Julia
3. Linear regression in R
4. Linear regression in Python
5. Logistic regression in R
6. KNN in python
7. Neural Networks in Python
8. Gradient Descent in Python
9. Classification trees in Python
10. K means in Python (unsupervised)
